# EnrageNotifier
A tera-proxy module that sends you a notice about a boss being enraged and the percentage of its next enrage.
  
## Usage  
While ingame, open a whisper chat session with "!EnrageNotifier" by typing "/w !enragenotifier" in chat and hitting the space bar.
This serves as the script's command interface. 
The following commands are supported:  
  
* on - Enables the script (default)  
* off - Disables the script  
  
Any other input returns a summary of above commands in the game.  
  
Alternative commands in all other chats:  
* !enrage - Toggles between "on" and "off" state  
  
## Safety
Whatever you send to "!EnrageNotifier" ingame is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.
